Welcome to my new blog! I plan to write posts about various web development topics of note that I come across in my daily work.

I built this blog in a couple of hours using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which is a static site generator tool built on the [Go](https://golang.org/) programming language. So far it's been a very simple and enjoyable experience. 

It only took a few template files written in a pretty straight-forward templating language to build a simple blog with tag support.

Adding additional features like categories, series, and other pretty standard blog functionality would take minutes, if I had the need for those features.

The built-in server with auto watch capabilities has made the development process a quick and enjoyable experience, the content generates so quickly, that I can hardly even notice it refreshing. 

Come back for ramblings, insights, and interesting topics.
