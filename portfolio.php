		<p class="desc">Plymouth State University decided to switch their versioning system from Subversion to Git. I migrated many applications from the Subversion repository to Git and uploaded them to GitHub. During this process all code needed to be scrubbed for sensitive data, non-public information, and in some cases required some functions to be re-written to bring them to standards. </p>

		<p class="desc">The Plymouth State Classroom Technology Services Toolkit was a full-scale web application that was built for the use of all students, faculty and staff and Plymouth State University. It's functionalities allow authenticated users to make equipment requests, and has a very large selection of administrative tools that allows the manager of the Classroom Technology Servcices Department (CTS) to assign his staff members to reservations for support, but also allows his staff to view available equipment from the Unversities inventory control system GLPI, assign equipment and edit loans, view their assignments, as well as support for help desk personal who will be the face to face contact for the person who created the loan. I took the project from product specification to production in only 5 months, after a rigourous code-review and debug process.   </p>

		<p class="desc"> A class project that started me on my path to become a web developer. We were assigned into teams of 6 people and had a month and a half to create a full scale web application with authentication, administration and tools. The project was designed as a tool for students and professors to use in order to rate the progress of groups. The professors would create classes and assign students to them, create groups, create deadlines for assessments, and monitor progress. The students were required to create assessments of their team mates based off 3-5 categories they had defined at the start of the class. They would determine how they would asses each other and were required to submit an assessment every time they were assigned. At the end of the assessment, each person would rate their teammates on a pie chart. This pie chart was created so that the students understood that when they added more points to an individual, another would lose points. The system was also designed so that the students could not disburse the points evenly among their teammates. In the end, 4 groups of us at set out to complete the project, some were a success and some were a failure. My team which I took the lead of, was able to submit a working project, with all of the necessary components of the project.  </p>

		<p class="desc">I worked as the lead in researching and testing virtual desktop infrastructure services. I met and discussed solutions with vendors, tested and documented the proposed solutions. I installed a complete instance of Citrix XenDesktop with XenApp, configured application delivery and virtual desktop delivery, and documented the processes to install, configure, and manage the system. I also installed, configured, and tested an instance of VMware Veeam to backup our virtual servers. </p>
