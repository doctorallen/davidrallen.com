		<h3 id="github">GitHub Migration</h3>
		<p class="desc">Plymouth State University decided to switch their versioning system from Subversion to Git. I migrated many applications from the Subversion repository to Git and uploaded them to GitHub. During this process all code needed to be scrubbed for sensitive data, non-public information, and in some cases required some functions to be re-written to bring them to standards. </p>

		<p class="desc">The Plymouth State Classroom Technology Services Toolkit was a full-scale web application that was built for the use of all students, faculty and staff and Plymouth State University. It's functionalities allow authenticated users to make equipment requests, and has a very large selection of administrative tools that allows the manager of the Classroom Technology Servcices Department (CTS) to assign his staff members to reservations for support, but also allows his staff to view available equipment from the Unversities inventory control system GLPI, assign equipment and edit loans, view their assignments, as well as support for help desk personal who will be the face to face contact for the person who created the loan. I took the project from product specification to production in only 5 months, after a rigourous code-review and debug process.   </p>

		<p class="desc">I worked as the lead in researching and testing virtual desktop infrastructure services. I met and discussed solutions with vendors, tested and documented the proposed solutions. I installed a complete instance of Citrix XenDesktop with XenApp, configured application delivery and virtual desktop delivery, and documented the processes to install, configure, and manage the system. I also installed, configured, and tested an instance of VMware Veeam to backup our virtual servers. </p>
