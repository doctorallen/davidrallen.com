          <h2>Early Memories</h2>
          <p>
            My earliest memory of using a computer was with my Mother's{' '}
            <strong>brother</strong> word processor (I'm not sure what model),
            that had a wonderful orange glowing CRT monitor. I remember figuring
            out one day how to load Tetris while messing around with the command
            line. I think I was around 7 or 8 at the time. That's around the
            same time my grandmother got a new computer, a Compaq Presario,
            complete with a dial-up connection provided by AOL. It was set up
            right in her dining room.

          <p>
            We spent like what felt like hours asking Jeeves as many questions
            as we could think of. My mind was reeling thinking about all of the
            possibilities with this new found technology. Eventually I went back
            to playing{' '}

            that became a career.

          <h2>Hello World</h2>
          <p>
            I made my first website using freewebs.com in 2004. The James Bond
            video game Everything or Nothing had recently been released on
            Playstation 2, and 14 year old me felt that I needed to share my
            knowledge and opinion of the game, all wrapped in a bright red
            website.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a few basic website with freewebs.com, I moved onto learning
            Flash. I was a big fan of all of the games you could find for free
            on{' '}
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newgrounds.com/">
              newgrounds.com
            </a>
            , and I wanted to learn how to code my own video games, so I dove in
            learning Action Script 2 and how to animate in Adobe Flash.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Highschool I got the chance to take a Web Design class, where we
            would get a chance to build and design our own websites in HTML. I
            had already starting teaching myself Photoshop, so I thought that it
            would be fun to start building websites from scratch. We built basic
            websites using Dreamweaver and Notepad++, but I wanted more of a
            challenge, so for my second project I built a website entirely in
            Flash.
          </p>
          <p>
            Flash was interesting, but I wanted to learn more about programming,
            and luckily my Highschool offered an Introduction to Programming
            course using Visual Basic 6. I wrote my first "hello world" program
            in 2006. I took to it quickly, staying up late reading the text book
            so I could learn the next programming concept or bit of syntax
            before we would learn it in class. A few days a week I worked as a
            dishwasher after school, and I would come home and spend hours
            programing video games and designing game assets.
          </p>
          <p>
            After I finished the Introduction to Programming class I wanted to
            dig further into programming, but my school did not offer any
            additional programming classes unless enough students signed up. So
            I tried to enlist some friends to take a C++ class the following
            semester, but unfortunately we did not get enough students to sign
            up to make the class a reality. Luckily the professor lent me the
            text book so I could study it on my own (thanks Mr. Fogarty).
            However, the Introduction to Programming class was still popular
            enough, and I was able to come back to the class as a teacher's
            assistant, to provide help to the students as they were learning.
            The experience of aiding my peers in that class prooved to be
            invaluable in my career, not just with my coworkers, but also when I
            started teaching a programming bootcamp 13 years later.

          <h2>Graduating</h2>
          <p>
            After graduating highschool in 2008, I went to Daniel Webster
            College to persue a degree in "Gaming, Simulation, and Robotics",
            but it was the gaming part that sold me. I had always enjoyed
            programming games, and I wanted to learn how the professionals did
            it. I quickly learned that the awesome 3D games we were shown during
            our tour of the school were the product of a group of high skilled
            students in their senior year, we ended up spending the first few
            months writing basic terminal applications in C#. Eventually we
            moved on to programming graphical elements, and working with the XNA
            gaming framework but it wasn't as exciting as I thought it would be.
          </p>
          <p>
            I spent the summer between my Freshman and Sophomore years at Daniel
            Webster College, I had started working for the IT department shortly
            after I started school and they offered for a few of us to stay on
            campus to help support the full time IT staff. During this time I
            developed a love for the IT side of the world, imaging desktops,
            setting up network devices, running ethernet cables, testing ports.
            Now that I think about it, I don't really understand why I was
            interested in IT at all, maybe it was just the people that I liked.
            But one thing that I did know was that I wanted to change my major,
            which I did to "Management Information Systems" for my Sophomore
            year.

          <h2>Information Technolgy</h2>
          <p>
            After switching majors I started to get get introduced to more
            information technology and business focused topics. I learned about
            relational databases, how computers were built, networking,
            economics, technical writing, etc. I was fascinated with many of
            these topics, and they seemed more inline with a legitimate career
            than the promised pipe-dream of a video game developer. Then things
            started to change.
          </p>
          <p>
            We heard rumors, especially since I worked for IT and they were
            clued into everything, that the school was facing financial
            difficulties and might be sold to ITT tech. I'm not sure what ITT
            tech's play was with what was primarily a Pilot and Air Traffic
            Controller school, but they did purchase the school in 2009, which
            spurred me to transfer to Plymouth State University in my hometown.

          <h2>Transfer Student</h2>
          <p>
            I transferred to Plymouth State University in 2010 to finish a
            degree my degree in Information Technology. Transferring into
            Plymouth State was a great experience, I was back in my home town,
            and my best friend had started the semester before. Not only that
            but a good friend of mine transferred with me from Daniel Webster,
            so I had a social jump start. I started working at the IT help desk
            before the school year had even begun, with the help of an old
            Highschool friend who already worked there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Plymouth State was where I really thrived. I was enjoying my
            classes, I was working, I volunteered in a few student
            organizations. I lived off campus for my Junior year, but I spent
            almost all of my time on campus, riding my bike back home in the
            dark most nights.
          </p>
          <p>
            I took the opportunity of transfering to a new school as a fresh
            start. Many people say you get out what you put into your experience
            in college, and I wanted to make my last 2 years count. I took every
            opportunity I could to volunteer, work, assist teachers, and learn
            new things. I was setting up lab assignments, grading homework,
            planning cirriculum all for courses I hadn't even taken (since I had
            gotten transfer credit for those courses), and I enjoyed every
            minute of it. I also got a chance to get back to my old love,
            programming, after a year-long hiatus.

            It started with Java, then Visual Basic .NET, followed by PHP and
            JavaScript. My last year at Plymouth State University was full of
            new programming languages and I couldn't get enough. I also had the
            opportunity to build my first full-fledged web application with a
            team of three other developers. We built it using PHP, HTML, CSS,
            and JavaScript with a MySQL database. While learning PHP, MySQL, and
            JavaScript for the first time, we also learned Git, and I forced
            myself to learn Vim to make it that much harder for me. The
            professor took notice, which ended up helping me land my first job
            after graduating. The "Rate Your Mate" application was a great
            learning experience, and set me up for my senior thesis project as I
            would go on to build a web application using similar technolgy.

          <h2>Classroom Technology Services</h2>
          <p>
            My senior thesis project had come from an internal group at Plymouth
            State, the Classroom Technology Services (CTS) team. They were
            responsible for maintaining all of the classroom technolgy like
            projectors, TVs, computers, etc. They also loaned out a lot of
            technolgy as professors needed specific equipment for certain
            lessons, but they didn't have a good system for managing all of the
            reservations. I worked with Todd, the manager of the CTS group, to
            determine what their goals were, and what I could build to help them
            solve their biggest pain points.
          </p>
          <p>
            I ended up working with our Management Information Systems (MIS)
            team on campus, who developed dozens of web applications for
            Plymouth State, so that my application would integrate with their
            technology and be available to every student and faculty member that
            needed to request classroom technology. It was an added complication
            to have to interoperate with their existing system, but ultimately I
            wanted to build an application that would be used by real people,
            not just a demo for my senior thesis.
